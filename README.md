"block collision problem." It connects principles of conservation of momentum and energy in elastic collisions with the digits of 
𝜋

Setup: Two blocks are placed on a frictionless surface. One block is much heavier than the other, and their masses are in a specific ratio (e.g., 1:100, 1:10,000, etc.). A wall is placed to the left of the smaller block.

Initial Conditions: The larger block starts moving towards the smaller block with some initial velocity, while the smaller block is stationary.

Collisions:

The blocks collide elastically with each other.
The smaller block also collides elastically with the wall.
Counting Collisions: Each collision (whether between blocks or the block and the wall) is counted. The number of collisions relates to the digits of 
𝜋
π.

The Connection to 
𝜋
π:
The total number of collisions corresponds to the first digits of 
𝜋
π. Specifically:

If the masses are in a ratio of 
1
:
100
1:100, there will be 31 collisions.
For 
1
:
10
,
000
1:10,000, the number of collisions increases to 314, and so on.
This connection arises because the behavior of the system mirrors the mathematical process of 
𝜋
π-related calculations when considering the square root of the mass ratios. The mathematical explanation involves mapping the system’s dynamics to a geometric problem involving a quarter-circle.
